# Wireless-Communication
From flower to flower using XBees

XBee modules are embedded solutions providing wireless end-point connectivity to devices. These modules use the IEEE 802.15.4 networking protocol for fast point-to-multipoint or peer-to-peer networking.

For these examples, I have used 2 **XBee Pro Series 2** modules.

Targets to acheive:
* ~~Send text from PC to Arduino and write it in a file on the SD card~~
* Send text from Arduino to Arduino and write it in a file on the SD card
* Send file from Arduino to Arduino and calculate a checksum for it
* more to come
